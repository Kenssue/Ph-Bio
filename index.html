        <p>  <br> &#8203 &#8203   Is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia. It is situated in the western Pacific Ocean, and consists of about 7,640 islands, that are <br> &#8203 &#8203 broadly categorized under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The Philippines is <br> &#8203 &#8203 bounded by the West Philippine Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to the east, and the Celebes Sea to the southwest, and shares <br> &#8203 &#8203  maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Japan to the northeast, Palau to the east and southeast, Indonesia to the south, Malaysia to <br> &#8203 &#8203   the southwest, Vietnam to the west, and China to the northwest. The Philippines covers an area of 300,000 km2 (120,000 sq mi) and, as of <br> &#8203 &#8203   2020, had a population of around 109 million people, making it the world's thirteenth-most populous country. The Philippines has  <br> &#8203 &#8203   diverse ethnicities and cultures throughout its islands. Manila is the national capital, while the largest city is Quezon City, both lying <br> &#8203 &#8203   within the urban area of Metro Manila.  <br> &#8203   </p><br><br>

        <p> <br> &#8203 &#8203  Negritos, some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples. Adoption of <br> &#8203 &#8203   animism, Hinduism and Islam established island-kingdoms called Kedatuans, Rajahnates and Sultanates. The arrival of Ferdinand <br> &#8203 &#8203   Magellan, a Portuguese explorer leading a fleet for Spain, marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy <br> &#8203 &#8203   López de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain. Spanish settlement through Mexico, <br> &#8203 &#8203   beginning in 1565, led to the Philippines becoming part of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years. During this time, Catholicism <br> &#8203 &#8203   became the dominant religion, and Manila became the western hub of trans-Pacific trade. In 1896, the Philippine Revolution began, <br> &#8203 &#8203   which then became entwined with the 1898 Spanish–American War. Spain ceded the territory to the United States, while Filipino <br> &#8203 &#8203   revolutionaries declared the First Philippine Republic. The ensuing Philippine–American War ended with the United States establishing <br> &#8203 &#8203   control over the territory, which they maintained until the Japanese invasion of the islands during World War II. Following liberation, <br> &#8203 &#8203   the Philippines became independent in 1946. Since then, the unitary sovereign state has often had a tumultuous experience with <br> &#8203 &#8203   democracy, which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by the People Power Revolution. <br> &#8203 &#8203  </p><br><br>

        <p> <br> &#8203 &#8203  It is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country, which has an economy transitioning from being based on <br> &#8203 &#8203   agriculture to being based more on services and manufacturing. The Philippines is a founding member of the United Nations, World <br> &#8203 &#8203   Trade Organization, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the East Asia Summit. <br> &#8203 &#8203   The Philippines' position as an island country on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the country prone to <br> &#8203 &#8203   earthquakes and typhoons. The country has a variety of natural resources and a globally significant level of biodiversity. <br> &#8203 &#8203  </p><br><br>
